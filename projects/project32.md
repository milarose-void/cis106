Project 32/Deliverable 3

## Introduction
This project is about how to recover files from an erased disk using Kali Linux. I have set up a USB Flash Drive with folders that contain texts, pdfs, and pictures within the folders and will be replicating what happens when it all gets erased completey. Despite it not being 100% comparable to doing it within an actual hard drive, it will be similar and will use the programs I explained in Deliverable 2.

I will be trying 3 different programs to view how much is capable of being recovered.

**Getting Started**
Here is a photo of what will be contained inside the USB:

What I will be doing next is erasing the drive completely through both the macbook and Kali Linux. I will be setting up the USB Drive first through the macbook to then transfer everything over to the Raspberry Pi.

After I finished preparing everything I "erased" every bit of content that was transferred over after it was set.

**First to try with recoverjpeg**
As stated before, recoverjpeg is a tool used to mainly recover drives that contain photos. As it can be seen, there are 4 photos in the sets of folders. Along with a text document and pdf of a book, they will be erased. 

When using Kali Linux, there are a specific set of commands to use in which will be shown below step by step.

Step 1 - 

**Now to try with PhotoRec**
To assume that whatever else was on the Flash Drive could have been corrupted and caused the "erasure", this program will come in handy. 

This is pretty compatible with TestDisk, however I do not believe it is needed. I could be wrong but we can test it anyways to see if it will do recovery related things for the drive.

**The last program to try: Foremost** 

This is considered the most reliable or accurate tool to use as the files within the folders were erased completely. It is able to recover many of the main types of files, as for this project, the types of files are pdf, txt, and png files. Just for the basics. 

In the following lines will show the step by step of how this tool will be used to ultimately recover all of the files.
