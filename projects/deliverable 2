#32 Final Project

## What is being used to conduct the project?
* Raspberry Pi 4 with Kali Linux Installed
* USB Flash Drive
* Monitor
* Keyboard
* Mouse

## Resources for Kali Linux
* Based on research there are programs within Kali Linux that provide assistence with data recovery on erased disks, for example:
  *   Foremost - a forensic tool that can recover data from permanently erased disks based on their headers, footers and international data structure. 
  *   Scalpel - locater of files within a database and extracts matching photos from images
  *   recoverjpeg - this program is to recover drives that hold images or was considered a digital camera memory (like PhotoRec)
  *   Testdisk - Helps in recovering lost partitions within your disks

* There are multiple ways to recover erased data fbut for this project I will be using Foremost, PhotoRec, and Testdisk.
  * A USB drive that's set up will be used as the device that will be accidentally "Erased"

Websites that will be used for assistance:
* Kali.org
* Youtube.com
* Kalilinux.in
* Hackinpill.blogspot.com

How will I perform this project?
**I will spend time studying and watching videos on how each tool is used. This may take some time due to work and college schedule. When it is time to complete this project I will be installing the tools via the terminal and with the commands I learned, will be practicing how to use them correctly**
