# **Part 1**
1. What are the advantages of open source? **The advantages of open source would be the ability to modify and use a program to their own preference.**
2. What are the basic freedoms that make a software open source? **The basic freedoms that come with using open sourced software would be the ability to use the program, the ability to study and modify the program, the ability to redistribute copies of the program and the ability to distribute modified copies of the program.**
3. Why do you think people should use the free software/open-source alternative instead of the proprietary version? **People should use free open source software as an alternative due to the fact they will not be restricted to what they are able to modify or view. With the unlimited resources they can find will also provide them with free assistance if it is required whereas if using a proprietary software would contain having to pay to just get some help on a program that may require a lot of maitanence.** 
4. Watch the following video: Why is free software important? Richard Stallman - in INT's ENLIGHTENMENT MINUTES. Do you agree with Richard Stallman? Do you disagree? Explain your answer. **I agree with his statement about how the users should have freedom with their computers. Despite not everyone being tech savvy, they should be aware of what they are using so they don't become vulnerable to what may be hidden within a program. It is a threat in a way when a proprietary sourced software limits all the information that is needed to be aware of what the program is doing.**
